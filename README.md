• Designed and implemented a 3-Way Smart Switch Board enabling flexible control of lights and fans through Manual, Automatic, and Wi-Fi modes.
• Utilized MOSFET-based switching and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to efficiently regulate fan speed.
• Integrated temperature and humidity sensors along with a photoresistor to enhance automation and energy efficiency by adjusting operations based on environmental conditions.
• Developed using Arduino UNO, ensuring reliable performance and easy programmability.
